# Nidoranarion Theme

A very good theme for Oh-My-Zsh.
It is intended for my personal use so the features can feel limited to other people.
Git is the only VCS that is supported since I don’t use anything else anyway.
The theme doesn’t specify any colors explicitly but uses the terminal colors.

## Screenshots

With a light terminal colorscheme:

With a dark terminal colorscheme:

The circles are VCS indicators. From left to right: Untracked files, unstaged files, staged files, unpushed commits.
I omit the username on purpose since I rarely have to switch back and forth between local and remote terminals.

## Features
* no powerline fonts required
