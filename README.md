# Nidoranarion Theme

A very good theme for Oh-My-Zsh.
Git is the only VCS that is supported since I don’t use anything else anyway.
The theme doesn’t specify any colors explicitly but uses the terminal colors.

The circles are VCS indicators. From left to right: Untracked files, unstaged files, staged files, unpushed commits.
